    * Proving identity is an off chain contract between the account holder and
    * the recovery account. The recovery request contains a new authority which
    * must be satisfied by the account holder to regain control. The actual process
    * of verifying authority may become complicated, but that is an application
    * level concern, not a blockchain concern.
    *
    * This operation requires both the past and future owner authorities in the
    * operation because neither of them can be derived from the current chain state.
    * The operation must be signed by keys that satisfy both the new owner authority
    * and the recent owner authority. Failing either fails the operation entirely.
    *
    * If a recovery request was made inadvertently, the account holder should
    * contact the recovery account to have the request deleted.
    *
    * The two setp combination of the account recovery request and recover is
    * safe because the recovery account never has access to secrets of the account
    * to recover. They simply act as an on chain endorsement of off chain identity.
    * In other systems, a fork would be required to enforce such off chain state.
    * Additionally, an account cannot be permanently recovered to the wrong account.
    * While any owner authority from the past 30 days can be used, including a compromised
    * authority, the account can be continually recovered until the recovery account
    * is confident a combination of uncompromised authorities were used to
    * recover the account. The actual process of verifying authority may become
    * complicated, but that is an application level concern, not the blockchain's
    * concern.
